### Algorithm for Matrix Operations

1. **Start**

2. **Input Matrices**
   - Input dimensions (rows and columns) and elements for two matrices A and B.

3. **Display Options**
   - Show options for operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.

4. **Perform Operation Based on User Input**
   - **Addition**: Add corresponding elements of A and B.
   - **Subtraction**: Subtract corresponding elements of A and B.
   - **Multiplication**: Perform matrix multiplication if dimensions match; otherwise, display an error message.
   - **Transpose**: Generate transpose for A or B based on user choice.

5. **Display Result**
   - Show the resulting matrix for the selected operation.

6. **Repeat or Exit**
   - Allow the user to perform another operation or exit the program.

7. **End**
