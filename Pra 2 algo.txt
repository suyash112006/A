#### Deposit Algorithm

1. **Start**

2. **Enter Amount**
   - Prompt the user to enter the amount to be deposited.

3. **Add to Balance**
   - Add the entered amount to the current balance.

4. **Display Updated Balance**
   - Show the updated balance to the user.

5. **End**

#### Withdrawal Algorithm

1. **Start**

2. **Enter Amount**
   - Prompt the user to enter the amount to be withdrawn.

3. **Check Balance**
   - If the entered amount is greater than the current balance:
     - Display message: "Insufficient balance."
     - Withdrawal is not allowed if it causes the balance to go negative.
   - Else:
     - Subtract the entered amount from the current balance.

4. **Display Updated Balance**
   - Show the updated balance to the user.

5. **End**

This simplified version of the algorithms should be easy to remember and write during an exam. If you need further details or explanations, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
